###Description of tools choice
* **React:** Is a library allows the creation of web components and it optimises the way elements are loaded into the DOM (re-rendering), in comparison to plain JavaScript, replacing only the updated nodes on the DOM when any changes are made to the components (through the React virtual DOM).
* **SASS:** Makes manipulation of styling feel a bit "smarter" than only using CSS. Eg: Sass variables allow for easy replacement and usage of colors within the styles files
* **Axios:** Chose axios beacuse is an HTTP client that is based in promises, which allows information to be loaded asynchronously, and I find it easy to use
